        <h2>Stock Market</h2>
        <p>The stock market is a dynamic system where investors can <em>buy, sell, and trade</em> shares of publicly
            traded companies. It operates through exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq,
            where stocks are listed and traded. At its core, the stock market functions as a marketplace where companies
            raise capital by offering ownership stakes in the form of shares, and investors can buy these shares to own
            a portion of the company.</p>
